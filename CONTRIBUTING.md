# Guidelines

- Adding everything available out there is not the goal!
- Do not add things you have not evaluated personally!
  - Use your critical thinking to filter out non-essential stuff.
  - Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included.
- Create a Single PR for Content Additions.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones.
